        <br>
        <p> I'm an intern at the <a href="https://ictkerala.org/" target="_blank">ICT Academy of Kerala</a>, currently undertaking a project focused on credit score classification using machine learning algorithms.<br><br>In this academic endeavor, I delve into the intricate world of credit assessment, aiming to develop a user-friendly solution for categorizing credit scores into three distinct classes: Good, Standard, and Poor. Through the amalgamation of data science and web development, I strive to create an intuitive platform that aids individuals in understanding and evaluating their creditworthiness.<br><br>This project not only serves as a testament to my academic pursuits but also reflects my passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. With guidance from mentors and support from the ICT Academy, I embark on this journey to sharpen my skills, expand my knowledge, and contribute meaningfully to the field of machine learning and web development.<br><br>As you explore this website, I invite you to witness the culmination of months of dedication, learning, and innovation. Thank you for joining me on this endeavor to empower individuals with valuable insights into their financial health.</p>
